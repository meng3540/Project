# Output Results
This folder contains the visual and performance output data generated during the execution of our real-time object detection pipeline on the Jetson Orin Nano. It includes annotated screenshots from the live video feed, terminal logs showing detection statistics, and GPU utilization snapshots using jtop. These artifacts serve as evidence of successful implementation, verification of GPU acceleration, and real-time inferencing capabilities of the deployed system.
